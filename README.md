# Neural Network-Based Collaborative Filtering for Question Sequencing

E-Learning systems (ELS) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) take a major part in today’s education programs. Sequencing questions is the art of generating a
personalized quiz for a target learner. 

A personalized test will enrich the learner’s experience and will contribute to a
more effective and efficient learning process. 
in this project we used the Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model togenerate question sequencing and compare it to a pair-wise memory-based question sequencing algorithm - Edurank. 

the NCF model showed significantly better ranking results than the Edurank model with an Average percision correlation score of 0.85 compared to 0.8.
